As technology advances, smaller yet more powerful microprocessors and microcontrollers are becoming available. OSAVC addresses the need for a dedicated, modular real-time controller that can be integrated into distributed control architectures for autonomous vehicles and systems.</p><h2 id="problem-statement" tabindex="-1">Problem Statement <a class="header-anchor" href="#problem-statement" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Problem Statement&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The lack of a vehicle-agnostic, real-time controller for autonomous vehicles and systems is a significant challenge. OSAVC aims to address this by providing a flexible, open-source solution that supports real-time computation, adaptability to different vehicle configurations, and accessibility to a broad community of users and contributors.</p><h2 id="architecture-overview" tabindex="-1">Architecture Overview <a class="header-anchor" href="#architecture-overview" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Architecture Overview&quot;">​</a></h2><p>OSAVC consists of several key components:</p><ul><li><strong>Real-time Autopilot:</strong> Provides real-time control and computation capabilities, allowing integration with different vehicle types and algorithms.</li><li><strong>Single Board Computer (SBC):</strong> Enables non-real-time tasks and access to advanced computational packages, extending the system&#39;s capabilities beyond real-time functions.</li><li><strong>Tensor Processing Unit (TPU):</strong> Facilitates onboard machine learning capabilities, such as object detection and image classification, without overburdening the SBC.</li></ul><h2 id="features" tabindex="-1">Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Features&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>Modular and adaptable design for various vehicle types.</li><li>Real-time computation for precise control and estimation algorithms.</li><li>Integration with SBC for non-real-time tasks and advanced computation.</li><li>Onboard machine learning capabilities for object detection and classification.</li><li>Open-source hardware and firmware, promoting collaboration and innovation.</li></ul><h2 id="getting-started" tabindex="-1">Getting Started <a class="header-anchor" href="#getting-started" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Getting Started&quot;">​</a></h2><p>For detailed instructions on setting up and using the OSAVC controller, please refer to the <a href="./FirstProject">Building your first projects section</a>.</p><h2 id="contributions" tabindex="-1">Contributions <a class="header-anchor" href="#contributions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Contributions&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Contributions to the OSAVC project are welcome!
